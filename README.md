# prepladder-poc
50 days before, I introduced a critical vulnerability in prepladder (an indian top edtech company) and informed the concerned department but still they  have not released a patch for it (may be not interested).
So i have right to pubish the PoC. Now I am publishing the documents to the web according to the international rules of pubilshing PoC.

## What can you do with this PoC?
### Manipulate APIs
### Change data
### Access to video lectures
### Access other contents

### Note: All encrypted libraries are included in the project along with keys which are used by the project
### Note: Prepladder is also offering Bug Bounty Program
